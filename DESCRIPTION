Description: To identify differentially activated TFs by examing their target genes.
    Instead of comparing the expression of the TFs themselves, the significance of a TF activation was measured by Fisherâ€™s exact test on its target genes. The package includes a total of 3144 TF-target activation relationships and 1922 TF-target repression relationships derived from published articles (Han H et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 2018;46(D1):D380-d6.).
